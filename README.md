# pyImgCmp
Simple module used to compare two images.

Will be using this for another project at some point. Just the basics right now.
Project will need to pull images from local files and compare with images from a url so I set it up to work easily that way.

This library should handle all of the resizing, cropping before the comparison. Don't want to deal with those problems
in the other project so I'll use this library to handle all of the image comparison stuff.
